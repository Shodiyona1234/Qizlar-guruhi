        <p class="instructor">
          As a marathon runner, I was looking to hire a yoga instructor to
          complement my running regime and to relieve running related aches and
          pains. Most of the trainers I found online were not up to the mark.
          Either they were not certified or they did not have the requisite
          experience to train clients with specific need such as me.
